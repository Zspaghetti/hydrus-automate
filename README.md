Spend less time organizing and more time enjoying your collection. Hydrus Automate is your personal media butler, using an intuitive web interface to create "set it and forget it" rules for your library.

Want to automatically send files with a particular **tag** to a specific **domain**? Need to change the **rating** on all files that have a certain combination of tags? Set up a rule once, and let hydrus automate handle the tedious work for you on a recurring schedule of your choosing.
